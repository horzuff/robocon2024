I assume You already have python installed and are using windows. The first step will be to install poetry and create a new project with it.
```python
python -m venv .venv
.venv/scripts/Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
python -m pip install poetry
```

Now let's create our project

`poetry new web_testing_with_rf_and_browser`
